    This health check system monitors:
    - Backend API (Spring Boot with actuator)
    - Frontend (Nginx with custom health endpoint)
    - Auth service (Spring Boot with actuator)
    - Database connectivity (via backend actuator)
    - Market price tracker microservice

    Health checks run every 5 minutes and report to external monitoring if configured.
    Failed services are logged with detailed debugging information.
